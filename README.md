Twitter Backend API

This repository contains a simplified backend API for a Twitter-like platform. Users can register, log in, post tweets, follow other users, and view tweets in their feed. The project is built with Go, using GORM for database interactions and Uberâ€™s dig for dependency injection.

Features
â€¢	User Management: Register and log in with secure authentication.
â€¢	Tweets: Create, retrieve, and manage tweets.
â€¢	Follow System: Follow other users and view their tweets in your feed.
â€¢	Authentication: Middleware to secure endpoints using JWT-based authentication.
â€¢	Extensibility: Built with scalable architecture and dependency injection using Uberâ€™s dig.
â€¢	Structured Logging: JSON-based logger for monitoring API usage and debugging.
â€¢	MySQL Integration: Persistent storage for user and tweet data using GORM ORM.
â€¢	Testing: Unit-tested services and handlers for robust functionality.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
â€¢	Go 1.19+
â€¢	Docker and Docker Compose
â€¢	MySQL Server

Installation
1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/piyush-sib/twitter.git
cd twitter

	2.	Build and start the application with Docker Compose:

docker-compose up --build


	3.	Seed the database with dummy data:



	4.	The API should now be available at http://localhost:8080.

API Endpoints
Complete API documentation along with sample request and response is available in Twitter.postman_collection.json file.
You can easily import this collection in your postman

make test

Future Improvements
â€¢	Add WebSocket support for real-time updates (e.g., notifications).
â€¢	Implement pagination for large tweet and feed responses.
â€¢	Add support for media attachments in tweets.
â€¢	Improve test coverage with integration and end-to-end tests.
â€¢	Add caching with Redis to improve feed performance.
